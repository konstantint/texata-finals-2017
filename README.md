Texata 2017 Finals Solution
===========================

This is the solution to the "stock market prediction" task, presented at the final round of the [Texata 2017](http://texata.com/) competition on November 19 in Austin, Texas.

The repository contains the following files:

  * `server_setup.sh` documents the configuration of the cloud machine used during the contest.
  * `Texata 2017 - Beating the Stock Market (in 4 hours).ipynb` is the Jupyter notebook, containing the Python code of the solution, as it was developed during the 4 hour competition period. The `.html` file with the same name is the same notebook exported to HTML for convenience.
  * `Presentation.pdf` - the slides explainig the solution. These were also developed during the 4 hour competition time slot, and cleaned-up slightly after the contest for the award ceremony presentation.

This solution was awarded the second prize.
