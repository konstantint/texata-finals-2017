Texata 2017 Finals Solution
===========================

This is the solution to the "stock market prediction" task, developed by [Konstantin](http://fouryears.eu) and presented at the final round of the [Texata 2017](http://texata.com/) competition on November 19 in Austin, Texas.

The repository contains the following files:

  * [`server_setup.sh`](https://github.com/konstantint/texata-finals-2017/blob/master/server_setup.sh) documents the configuration of the cloud machine used during the contest.
  * [`Texata 2017 - Beating the Stock Market (in 4 hours).ipynb`](https://github.com/konstantint/texata-finals-2017/blob/master/Texata%202017%20-%20Beating%20the%20Stock%20Market%20(in%204%20hours).ipynb) is the Jupyter notebook, containing the Python code of the solution, as it was developed during the 4 hour competition period. The [`.html` file with the same name](https://github.com/konstantint/texata-finals-2017/blob/master/Texata%202017%20-%20Beating%20the%20Stock%20Market%20(in%204%20hours).html) is the same notebook exported to HTML for convenience.
  * [`Presentation.pdf`](https://github.com/konstantint/texata-finals-2017/blob/master/Presentation.pdf) - the slides explaining the solution. These were also developed during the 4 hour competition time slot, and cleaned-up slightly after the contest for the award ceremony presentation.

This solution was awarded the second prize.
